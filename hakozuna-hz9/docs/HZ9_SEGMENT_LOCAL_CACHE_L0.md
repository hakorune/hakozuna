# HZ9 Segment Local Cache L0

## Purpose

```text
HZ9SegmentLocalCache-L0

status:
  design-prep only
  no allocator behavior yet

goal:
  open the next HZ9 substrate after OwnerPage, SlabPage, LocalArena, and
  StaticLocalPage all failed broad/default promotion gates
```

The target is not another admission flag around existing substrates. It is a
new local substrate shape for medium/main local throughput.

## Prior Evidence

```text
OwnerPage:
  clean route/lifetime API
  local body still pays owner-page state/bit costs
  ownerfast_bits helps some rows but is unstable

SlabPage:
  remote/profile wins are real
  local/small/default rows regress

LocalArena:
  can create local wins
  mixed local/remote mutation collapses broad rows

StaticLocalPage:
  static TLS bits preserve local-only reuse
  class-disable and local-streak admission are too weak for r50
  profile-local gate R5 does not produce a stable profile build
```

## Design Direction

```text
local substrate:
  per-thread medium segment cache
  segment-backed slots, not HZ8 medium-run objects
  no dynamic state ensure on every allocation
  no H8OwnerRecord / H8ThreadCtx field additions in L0

remote boundary:
  keep HZ8-style route / slot_state / pending authority
  remote frees must not mutate owner-local free bits directly
  remote-contaminated segment is retired or drained by owner, not reused as a
  normal local segment

RSS:
  HZ9 may retain more than HZ8, but only under an explicit segment cap
```

The central hypothesis:

```text
HZ9 needs a local segment body with lower local cost than OwnerPage and
LocalArena, while keeping remote contamination from turning the local segment
into a mixed mutable object.
```

## L0 Scope

```text
implement first:
  standalone segment metadata scaffold
  TLS static state shape
  deterministic smoke for slot bit transitions
  no allocator routing
  no public entry branch
  no owner record layout change

do not implement in L0:
  malloc/free behavior
  remote concurrent freelist
  global route table
  RSS policy
```

## Implemented Scaffold

```text
source:
  src/h8_hz9_segment_local_cache.c

test:
  tests/h8_hz9_segment_local_cache_smoke.c

build:
  smoke-hz9segmentlocalcache

flag:
  H9_SEGMENT_LOCAL_CACHE_L0
```

The scaffold is `_Thread_local` and not connected to allocator routing.

## Segment Model

```text
segment:
  one medium class
  fixed slot count from class geometry
  local_free_bits
  local_alloc_bits
  remote_pending_bits
  state = LOCAL | REMOTE_SEEN | RETIRED

local free:
  LOCAL segment only
  allocated -> local_free

remote free:
  mark remote_pending_bits
  move segment out of LOCAL

owner drain:
  consume remote_pending_bits
  decide whether segment becomes retired or reusable in a future behavior box
```

L0 only proves the bit/state body can exist without the previous dynamic state
ensure and without changing hot HZ8 structs.

## Gates

```text
source-shape:
  hz9-standalone-check passes
  no active source/script/doc/Makefile/mk file > 800 lines
  baseline H8OwnerRecord/H8ThreadCtx layout unchanged

smoke:
  put/take/free deterministic
  duplicate local free rejected
  remote mark moves segment out of LOCAL
  local allocation from REMOTE_SEEN rejected
  retire clears local eligibility

before behavior:
  run pre-substrate recheck
  compare source/code shape to baseline
```

## Decision Boundary

```text
continue if:
  scaffold stays layout-neutral
  local bit body is simpler than OwnerPage
  remote transition is explicit and owner-drainable

stop if:
  L0 requires new H8OwnerRecord/H8ThreadCtx fields
  L0 needs public entry checks
  L0 reintroduces mixed local/remote page mutation
```

This is the next HZ9 substrate lane. OwnerPage, SlabPage, LocalArena, and
StaticLocalPage remain evidence lanes unless a new hypothesis appears.
