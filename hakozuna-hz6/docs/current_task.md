# HZ6 Current Task

HZ6 is the active Windows/Linux implementation and benchmarking family. Keep
this file short; it is an orientation entry point, not the chronological
experiment ledger.

## Current Status

```text
R1 implementation remains modular across API, route, frontcache, transfer,
source, owner, policy, and fronts.

Windows selected-family lane status is maintained in HZ6_LANE_GUIDE.md and
HZ6_SELECTED_FAMILY_SUMMARY.md.

Ubuntu LD_PRELOAD status is maintained in HZ6_UBUNTU_PRELOAD_LANES.md.
Current Ubuntu selected default includes MidPage descriptor-out. The latest
MidPage register callsite audit shows route fallback is already eliminated on
the target row; register pressure is split between direct reuse and front alloc.
MidPage trusted activation source-block-check skip was tested and is no-go for
preload default because the target and tiny guard did not improve.
MidPage preload-boundary malloc skip is now selected with an unlikely size
guard plus noinline helper; it avoids empty transfer-first probes on the
MidPage direct-local path without adding a helper call to small rows.
The confirmation lane now compares selected default against an explicit
boundary-off control DSO.
The latest Ubuntu selected balance matrix shows HZ6 is strongest on
4096..16384: faster and lower-RSS than HZ4, much stronger than mimalloc/system,
but still behind HZ3 and tcmalloc on the speed/RSS frontier.
MidPageFrontcacheRSSAudit-L1 is now implemented as a diagnostic lane. The first
200K audit shows a large fixed allocator-local table cost plus expected
MidPage source payload pressure:
  16..4096     peak 100.25 MiB, static 61.73 MiB, frontcache 20.00 MiB
  1024..4096   peak 111.62 MiB, static 61.73 MiB, frontcache 20.00 MiB
  4096..16384  peak 114.88 MiB, static 61.73 MiB, frontcache 20.00 MiB
  raw: private/raw-results/linux/hz6_midpage_rss_audit_20260614_164214
AllocatorStaticTableTrim-L1 is now selected/default for Ubuntu preload:
  route table 131072 -> 65536
  descriptor table 32768 -> 16384
  source block table 4096 -> 2048
  frontcache bin capacity 8192 -> 4096
  confirm repeat-5 without stats:
    16..4096     41.519M / 100.62 MiB -> 43.581M / 79.75 MiB
    1024..4096   39.966M / 111.75 MiB -> 41.849M / 91.00 MiB
    4096..16384  40.863M / 115.25 MiB -> 42.904M / 94.38 MiB
  safety repeat-3: route/descriptor/source/frontcache/fallback failures all 0
  raw: private/raw-results/linux/hz6_static_table_trim_confirm_20260614_165003
Latest cross-allocator refresh after static table trim:
  raw: private/raw-results/linux/hz6_ubuntu_selected_balance_20260614_165226
  16..256     hz6 60.381M / 30.38 MiB
  16..4096    hz6 42.216M / 79.75 MiB
  1024..4096  hz6 39.672M / 91.00 MiB
  4096..16384 hz6 41.264M / 94.38 MiB
  On 4096..16384, HZ6 still trails tcmalloc speed
  (41.264M vs 44.812M) but now has lower RSS and better ops-per-MiB.
MidPage32KRun512-L1 is now selected/default for Ubuntu preload:
  HZ6_MIDPAGE_32K_RUN_BYTES 262144 -> 524288
  payload trim controls below 256K were no-go: RSS was flat while source_alloc
  increased and 4096..16384 slowed.
  confirm repeat-7 without stats:
    16..256      59.531M / 30.38 MiB -> 60.730M / 30.50 MiB
    16..4096     41.811M / 79.88 MiB -> 43.235M / 79.88 MiB
    1024..4096   40.856M / 91.12 MiB -> 41.568M / 91.00 MiB
    4096..16384  42.176M / 94.38 MiB -> 45.298M / 94.50 MiB
  safety repeat-3: route/source/alloc/fallback failures all 0
  raw: private/raw-results/linux/hz6_midpage_run512_confirm_20260614_194437

Latest MidPage closeout:
  keep descriptor-out selected
  keep register callsite counters as diagnostic-only
  keep free-cache counters as diagnostic-only
  keep transfer-probe counters as diagnostic-only
  keep trusted activation skip off
  keep trusted cache push off
  keep MidPage direct-local skip-transfer-first off
  keep noinline/branch-isolated transfer-skip off
  keep preload-boundary noinline transfer-skip selected
  keep static table trim selected
  keep MidPage 32K run512 selected
  keep preclassified malloc shape out of source
  keep MidPage target DSO as selected/control alias

Next Ubuntu MidPage work should not try more transfer-skip code-shape tweaks;
the broader cross-allocator matrix already confirmed the promoted outer-guard
noinline boundary. Do not chase route fallback, deeper free probing,
source-run-slot route registration, broad malloc code-shape changes, or
whole-helper free-cache replacement first.

Next recommended optimization lanes:
  FrontcacheCapacityShapeAudit-L1:
    next. The global frontcache4096 promotion is selected; the next frontcache
    step should be class-specific caps or colder-bin lazy storage, not another
    global-cap guess.

  MidPagePayloadTrimAudit-L1:
    closed. Smaller 32K runs are no-go for now; 512K is selected for speed.

Use HZ6_UBUNTU_MIDPAGE_NEXT_DESIGN.md as the implementation order for the next
MidPage pass. TransferProbeAudit-L1, target DSO, and guard-isolated helper
attempts are done. The final outer-guard noinline preload-boundary shape passed
the focused repeat-15 promotion guard and the selected-vs-boundary-off
confirmation lane.

## Cleanup Status

```text
The root repository source/script large-file audit is clean:
  ../../linux/audit_large_source_files.sh --top 20

Do not append long run logs here. Promote stable conclusions into the focused
HZ6 docs and move raw chronological evidence to archive docs.
```
