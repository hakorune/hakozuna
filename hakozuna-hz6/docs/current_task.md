# HZ6 Current Task

HZ6 is now in R1 implementation. Keep the implementation modular from the
start: API, route, frontcache, transfer, source, owner, policy, and future
fronts should stay separated.

## Current Claim

```text
HZ6 should be a route-safe, transfer-first, RSS-aware allocator family.

It should promote:
  HZ3 thin local cache
  HZ4 remote grouping
  HZ5 fail-closed descriptor ownership and low-RSS profile discipline

It should not directly port HZ3/HZ4/HZ5 internals.
```

## Active Documents

```text
hakozuna-hz6/README.md
hakozuna-hz6/docs/HZ6_BLUEPRINT.md
hakozuna-hz6/docs/HZ6_R1_MINIMUM_CONTRACT_BLUEPRINT.md
hakozuna-hz6/docs/HZ6_ARCHITECTURE_DRAFT.md
hakozuna-hz6/docs/HZ6_FOLDER_LAYOUT.md
hakozuna-hz6/docs/HZ6_MIGRATION_FROM_HZ5.md
```

## Proposed First Engineering Steps

```text
1. Review and tighten HZ6 folder layout. DONE.
2. Review HZ6_BLUEPRINT.md and select the first prototype. DONE.
3. Add headers/contracts first. DONE:
   include/hz6_contract.h
   include/hz6.h
   api/hz6_allocator.h
   route/hz6_route.h
   transfer/hz6_transfer.h
   source/hz6_source.h
4. Add route smoke before allocator behavior. DONE.
5. Add transfer smoke before full malloc/free integration. DONE.
6. Add first toy allocation path. DONE:
   api/hz6_allocator.c
   source/hz6_source.c
   frontcache/hz6_frontcache.c
   route/hz6_route.c
7. Add first transfer-first toy path. DONE:
   hz6_free_remote()
   ACTIVE -> TRANSFER_FREE
   transfer pop before source allocation
8. Choose first real target:
   Windows Local2P exact route, or Linux LargeFront 128K transfer.
9. Keep modular cleanup moving before real target:
   size-class mapping moved to frontcache/hz6_size_class.*
```

Current R1 smoke:

```bash
./hakozuna-hz6/linux/build_hz6_r1_contract_smoke.sh
```

## Open Decisions

```text
Route table shape:
  Windows sidecar table and Linux region/page map should share result contract,
  not implementation.

Transfer shard policy:
  consumer-visible shard remains the default idea, but HZ5 variants were no-go
  as patches. HZ6 must test it from a clean contract.

Fail-closed timing:
  strict profile uses immediate validation.
  speed remote profile may use batch-boundary validation only if invalid
  pointers cannot be promoted to reusable bins.

Profile names:
  use role names such as hz6-speed, hz6-rss, hz6-remote, hz6-strict.
  keep numeric knobs diagnostic-only.
```

## Not Yet

```text
No HZ5 source file migration.
No HZ5 code copy.
No new performance claim.
No benchmark table until an HZ6 prototype exists.
Toy allocation and transfer paths are for contract validation only.
```
